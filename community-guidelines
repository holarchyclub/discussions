A few guidelines for participating:

- Use the golden rule, treat other members how you wish to be treated
- Help make the community welcoming and supportive for people of all identities, cultures, abilities, traditions, and material positions
- In keeping with the above rule, some ideologies are explicitly banned: nazis, white supremacists, IQ worshipers, nihilists
- Allow space for dissenting opinions, value feedback and critique, allow for devils advocates [including discussion of above groups]
- Do not share sexual advances or explicit content
- When you are feeling agitated, overwhelmed, insulted, or otherwise uncomfortable, please say so! Sometime's it's best to take a break but other times we feel the need to speak through our pain - in these cases if we share how we feel our recipient(s) can take that into account. Our physiology makes us fight more than our hearts, and neither are transmitted online.
- When arguing obey the maxim "if you were them, you would think like them" - avoid the personal superiority complex of "i would be smarter about it"
- Acknowledge that disagreements over information often result from chasms of understanding, and to help someone cross that chasm requires extending our own hand and being willing to help catch them - AKA pick each other up when we fall and give benefit of doubt
